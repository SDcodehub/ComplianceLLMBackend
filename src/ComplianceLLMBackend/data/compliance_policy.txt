Marketing Treasury-based services
Create precise messaging for your users that complies with regulations.

Many states have statutory prohibitions on references to “banking," “banks," and “bank accounts” when the entities making these references are not state- or federally-chartered banks or credit unions. Imprecise terminology of Stripe Treasury accounts might draw scrutiny from regulators.

Yield compliance marketing guidance

As a platform, you can provide your customers with yield, calculated as a percentage of their Treasury balance. We understand that this can be a great value proposition as part of your product. When you market and disclose yield to your potential and existing customers, don’t conflate yield with interest. We’ve outlined best practices for your marketing disclosures below. If you have any questions on how to present yield in your marketing, contact our compliance team at platform-compliance@stripe.com


- Recommended Terms:Always refer to yield as “yield”.Always disclose prominently in your marketing materials that the yield percentage is subject to change and the conditions under which it might change.Notify your existing customers whenever the yield percentage has changed. Prominently display the most recent yield percentage in their dashboard.

- Terms to avoid, Never refer to yield as “interest”.Don’t reference the Fed Funds Rate as a benchmark for setting your yield percentage.Don’t imply that the yield is pass-through interest from a bank partner.


How to talk about FDIC insurance eligibility

Stripe Treasury balances are stored value accounts that are held “for the benefit of” our Stripe Treasury users with our bank partners, Evolve Bank & Trust and Goldman Sachs Bank USA. We disclose to you which of our partners hold your funds. For FDIC insurance to apply to a user’s balance in a “for the benefit of” account, we must satisfy the rules for FDIC pass-through deposit insurance, unlike a bank account directly with an FDIC insured bank.

We understand that FDIC insurance eligibility can be a valuable feature to your customers. Stripe has approved the variations of the phrase “FDIC Insurance eligible” noted below on marketing materials, as long as certain conditions are met.  Specifically, the statement of FDIC insurance eligibility must always be paired with two disclosures:

The following terms that incorporate the term “eligible” are approved:	
- “Eligible for FDIC insurance up to the standard maximum deposit insurance per depositor in the same capacity"
- “FDIC insurance-eligible accounts”
- “Eligible for FDIC insurance”
- “Eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance”
- “Eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250K”

Don’t use the following terms:
- “FDIC insured”
- “FDIC pass-through insurance guaranteed”
- “FDIC insured accounts”

We have also prepared these FAQs that you can use when your customers have questions about FDIC insurance eligibility or any of the disclosures:

Is FDIC insurance impacted if a customer holds deposits in other accounts with the same institution?	
It can be. It’s your responsibility to know which insured institutions hold your funds. If you have other business-purpose accounts with the same institution where Treasury funds are held, the FDIC might aggregate all of your business account balances with that institution in applying the 250,000 USD limit. The FDIC generally would not, however, aggregate your personal accounts with your business accounts.

How do I know if the requirements for FDIC pass-through insurance are met?	
Stripe Treasury accounts are designed to be eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance.  The FDIC makes the final determination about the availability of pass-through insurance at the time of a bank’s failure.

Does FDIC insurance eligibility protect from fraud or financial loss?	
No, FDIC insurance eligibility is applicable only in the event of a bank failure.
